# BubbleChat

---

BubbleChat is the chat website designed to turn the tables on meeting new people. Instead of searching for new friends yourself, we find them for you and put you in a race against the clock to have fun with your new-found friends and decide whether you like each other, or want to meet even more new people.

This is the main repository for BubbleChat, and contains the source code for the entire website.
